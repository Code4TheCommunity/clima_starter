# clima

The base starter project for the Flutter Clima App created in the [Flutter course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

*This is an open-source initiative for the community*

## Note

- The [original starter project](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Clima-Flutter) is out of date due to Flutter's breaking changes
- Clone this project and get started right away on the Clima Section of the course
- If you are looking for the full completed Clima project, it can be found [here](https://github.com/Code4TheCommunity/clima)
